# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks

This is a project from Codecademy with the aim to interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.

We will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, we will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
